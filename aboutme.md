Hey, this is Ekram—a maritime data analyst with a background that spans marine engineering, pharmaceutical retail, maritime tech startups, and a lot of time spent diving deep into data. I started my journey as a trainee marine engineer, working on ocean-going vessels, and over the years shifted toward data and tech, especially in the maritime and shipping space. Along the way, I’ve worked at early-stage startups, explored how data can make shipping smarter, and developed tools and insights around voyage simulation and optimization, vessel performance, process automation, weather routing, post-voyage reporting, and more.

Outside of work, I’m pretty obsessed with the ocean—not just from a seafarer’s point of view, but also in terms of marine life and sustainability. I'm also curious about aviation, healthcare tech, and renewable energy (particularly battery innovations). Basically, if it’s data-rich and meaningful, I want to explore it.

This blog is where I share some of those explorations—data projects, visualizations, and thoughts on topics I care about.

When I’m not working or geeking out over datasets, you’ll probably find me doing kettlebell workouts, long-distance swimming, or cruising around NYC on my e-bike or electric skateboard. I’m currently working on a few personal goals: getting my scuba certification, private pilot license, and skydiving license—all within this year. Wish me luck!

If anything in my blog catches your interest—or if you just feel like saying hi—I’d love to hear from you! Doesn’t matter who you are or where you are in your journey; if you feel like connecting, you’re more than welcome to. You can always find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekram-ullah-ahmed/), or you can just [email me](mailto:ekramullahzaki@gmail.com) —my inbox is always open!

P.S. I started this blog about five years ago, but didn’t pay much attention to it. Until recently, my "About Me" section still had a few lines from the default template claiming there was a movie made about me! Someone read that, got curious, endede up watching the whole movie, and was very confused until I explained it was just placeholder text.......funny, right?

I was going to remove it, but then thought... nah, I’ll just keep it as it is! If you do decide to watch the movie, just know—full disclosure—it has absolutely nothing to do with me! I hadn’t even seen it until I was asked about it......I'm no farm boy, and I definitely don't know any Buttercup! But it’s a good (kinda weird.....but good!) movie—so enjoy!

### My history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
