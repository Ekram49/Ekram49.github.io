Cricket is and has been the most popular sports in India for decades, way more than any other sports in the nation. When it comes to fan-following, even their national sports- Hockey doesn't even come close. As crazy as it may sound, to Indians Cricket is not only a sport, it is also like a religion to them. They have been one of the top ranked teams for quite some times and been respected and admired by Cricket fans all around the world. When they play in their home grounds with their 'Billions' of fans behind them, they are almost unbeatable. But that all changes when they go play abroad. India seems to struggle performing abroad while they do significantly well at home. That's why the phrase "Tigers at home, lambs abroad" has been associated to them by some of their "Fans(!)". But is the accusation valid? And if so, is India the only team to be blamed?
